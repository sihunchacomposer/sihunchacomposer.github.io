# Introduction

Sihun Cha (b. 1996, South Korea) is a composer whose work is driven by
vivid visual imagination and a strong sense of scene.
His music seeks to translate images and gestures into sound,
allowing listeners to experience visual impressions through listening.

Balancing emotional depth with structural clarity,
his compositions often explore tension, transformation,
and the physical presence of sound in performance.
Real-world contexts, staged situations, and the physicality of instruments
play an important role in shaping his musical language.
