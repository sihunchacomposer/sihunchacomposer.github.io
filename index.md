# Sihun Cha
Composer

---

Sihun Cha is a composer whose music transforms vivid visual
imagination into immersive sonic experiences.

His work is characterized by a strong sense of scene and gesture,
inviting the listener to perceive images through sound.
Balancing emotional depth with structural clarity,
he explores tension, transformation, and the physicality of musical performance.

Based in Germany, his practice spans contemporary music,
chamber and ensemble writing, and practical notation
closely connected to real performance situations.
