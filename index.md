# Sihun Cha
Composer & Arranger

## About
I am a composer and arranger based in Germany, working across  
contemporary music, ensemble writing, and practical notation  
for performers.

My work explores tension, structure, and transformation —  
often shaped by real-world contexts, staged situations,  
and the physicality of sound and performance.

독일을 기반으로 활동하는 작곡가·편곡가로,  
현대음악과 앙상블 작법, 그리고 연주 현장에서  
실제로 작동하는 악보에 관심을 두고 있습니다.
